# Salary Analysis

### Introduction
Using the data at hand I will attempt to answer the following questions.

1.How much does a degree matter in trying to attain a high paying job.? How much will taking out the degree factor help people now in attaining higher paying jobs?
2.How well can we predict an individual's salary? What aspects correlate well to salary?
3.How well can we predict previous prerequisites for scoring a high paying job?

### Data Used 
I am using data collected from kaggle.com. This data contains jobTypes, salary information, years of experience, college degree college major, industry and miles
from metropolis.Twenty percent of this dataset was split into a test dataset with corresponding salaries so accuracy and error of the model can be determined.

### Libraries I Used 
pandas 
sklearn 
numpy 
seaborn 
matplotlib
train_test_split
cross_val_score

### Summary
The result was a mean squared error of 354 with the accuracy of 76%.

We can confidentally use this model as a guide when determining salaries since it results in resonable predictions when given the neccesary information.
